# top-hn
A bot that tweets out the top-ranked post on Hacker News every 30 minutes!

This is a small project that I used to learn a bit more about the Twitter API, Python, bot-making, and other technologies.

You can find the bot's account on twitter at [@top_hn_bot](https://twitter.com/top_hn_bot "Top HN Bot Twitter Page").
